**Bottom-Up Multi-Document Localization Method in Unconstrained Environments**

## ðŸ“– Introduction
We propose a bottom-up approach for multi-document localization in unconstrained environments.  
This code reproduces the experiments described in our PRCV 2025 paper and provides an open-source baseline for further research.
